The R program run_analysis.R uses data files taken from the 'getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip' zipfile downloaded from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A description of the method used to collect the measurements in the original data set is provided below with a description of the features used in the data set.  The original data set includes multiple observations of subjects performing 6 activities.  The objective of this project was to identify the measurements in the orignal data set that evaluated the mean or standard deviation of on the features being measured and then to find the mean of each of these measurements for each subject and activity in the data set.


Description of run_analysis.R
============================
The program run_analysis.R reads in subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt and features.txt. as tables.  It then merges the data measurement files (X_test.txt and X_train.txt) to create testData and then uses the features file to name the columns.  It also merges the subject files to create subjectData and the y files which have the  activities for each measurement observation to create activityData.

It then uses the grepl command to create logical vectors indicating which measurements are means or standard deviations.  By "OR"ing the vectors, a vector with the measurements wanted for the final data set isidentified.  This is used to take a subset of the measurement data with the measuremetns of interest.

The program then creates a new table (testMeanStd) which adds the subjectData and activityData to testData.

The program then uses gsub to replace the activity numbers with the associated activity (i.e. 1 = "Sitting")

The program then uses lapply to find the means of each of the measurements for each subject and activity and then writes that file to Mean_by_Subject_Activity.txt.  The variables included in the final data set are given below.

Description of Original Data Set
=============================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



Description of the Features Selected for the Original Data Set 
=======================================================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
